Your best friend is in danger! An evil mastermind with a PhD in cryptosomething keeps him prisoner inside a cell that can only be opened by entering a secret 4-letter code. The evil mastermind is a total asshole, but he does value skills, so here's the deal: he will start a timer and present you with a board that contains the secret code in a slightly obfuscated form. 

If you will be able to figure out the code before the timer expires, good for you - and for your friend; otherwise, the cell where your friend is kept will be instantly filled with water, struck by a bolt, set on fire, compressed to the size of 1 cube millimeter, and eaten by a shark. Chances are your best friend won't survive that. Would you let that happen? Of course not!
